# F.A.Q.

Well...right now every question has been asked with a frequency of 0.
So instead, these are questions I imagine people will ask.

## Stocks and Bonds can mean many different things. What do you mean?
Right now stocks means SP 500 data. 
Bonds means Ibbotson's Long Term Corporate Bonds.
This is what the famous Trinity study used, so it is what I used.

## Why do you auto-populate stocks and bonds with 50% each?
I've agonized over this a lot. 
I hate the idea of suggesting an allocation.
You should pick an allocation yourself.
In the end, making the UI easy to use was more important to me than avoiding any subtle prescriptive advice.
50/50 was chosen because it seemed the least likely to imply that I am suggesting a specific allocation.

## Same story with all the other auto-population?
Yes.
I've tried to stay true to the sources for the various strategies in the context of how people have taken them.
For example, the Constant Amount withdrawal strategy populates with a 4% initial withdrawal, which seems to be the main takeaway from the Trinity study.
I don't mean to suggest that any of the pre-populated values are the right ones.

## I'm running IE6 and your site doesn't work.
People running old versions of Internet Explorer have no hope of ever retiring so it is okay that the site doesn't work.
Just assume 0% success rate on everything.

## How do I start developing code against this?
Great question. See the [github readme](https://github.com/gasserma/dwr/blob/master/README.md).

## What is up with this terrible bold font?
Calm down. The next commit will fix it. I need to go to bed though.
