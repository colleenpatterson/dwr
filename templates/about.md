This website came about because I found the existing literature (websites, papers, etc) on retirement withdrawals underwhelming.
Particularly, statistics presented in those various sources have trouble representing any sort of reality.
The problem how long one's nest egg will last are important and nuanced.
There is no unified set of metrics for assessing the quality of a retirement plan.
Simple metrics like success rate fail in catastrophic ways for certain withdrawal strategies.
A strategy in which you withdraw 99% of your portfolio every year will succeed.
But in less than 5 years you will have a nest egg worth a dime.

Rather than create a better set of metrics, I set out to provide the whole picture.
Graphically represented, simple and intuitive to understand, Visually pleasing and engaging.
